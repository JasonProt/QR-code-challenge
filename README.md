## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and be seen as the style guide declared.


```css
body {
	background-color:rgb(213, 215, 216);
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit';
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	height: 100vh;
}

.card {
	background-color:rgb(252, 252, 252);
	box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	border-radius: 1.5rem;
	max-width: 20rem;
	padding: 1rem;
	margin-bottom: 1rem;
}


```

### Continued development

I would like to make my own QR generator for website links.

QR codes are used in various fields, including advertising, marketing, logistics, healthcare, education and many others. They allow you to quickly and easily transfer information, which makes them very practical and convenient to use.

### Useful resources
